# User Guide: Profile Image Management

## Updating Your Profile Picture

2. **Locate Avatar**: In the "Basic Info" section, you will see your current avatar or a placeholder.
3. **Select Image**: Click on the camera icon overlay or the avatar area to open the file selector.
   - **Supported formats**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP.
   - **Max size**: 5MB.
   - **Min dimensions**: 100x100 pixels.
4. **Preview & Upload**: 
   - Once you select a file, a preview will appear immediately.
   - The system automatically uploads the image.
   - If successful, the new image will replace the old one.
   - If there is an error (e.g., file too large), an error message will appear.
5. **Save Profile**: The profile form will automatically update with the new image URL. You may need to click "Save Changes" if you made other edits, but the image upload is persisted immediately upon selection.
